Add ability to configure radius of Region - ObjC typedef double CLLocationDistance;

Add ability to configure accuracy -

 *  Discussion:
 *    Used to specify the accuracy level desired. The location service will try its best to achieve
 *    your desired accuracy. However, it is not guaranteed. To optimize
 *    power performance, be sure to specify an appropriate accuracy for your usage scenario (eg,
 *    use a large accuracy value when only a coarse location is needed).
